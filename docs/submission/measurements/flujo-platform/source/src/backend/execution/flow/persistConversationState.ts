/**
 * Persist a conversation's SharedState to storage WITHOUT the debug execution
 * trace.
 *
 * The trace (`executionTrace`) re-snapshots state on every step, so persisting
 * it grows the conversation file with each step. It lives in memory
 * (`FlowExecutor.conversationStates`) and is shipped to the debugger in the live
 * response, so it does not need to be durable. Every code path that writes a
 * conversation's state should go through here so the on-disk file stays lean.
 *
 * This is ALSO the single enforcement point for the ephemeral policy: a state
 * marked `ephemeral` (subflow child runs, future scheduler runs) is refused
 * outright, so it can never appear as a conversation in the chat sidebar. The
 * policy lives here, on the state, because per-call-site guards proved leaky —
 * an incremental persist path nobody remembered to guard wrote a subflow child
 * to disk. Do NOT add call-site `if (!ephemeral)` guards; they are redundant.
