/**
 * FlowSpec → Flow compiler (issue #14, flow generation; issue #94, multi-level nesting).
 *
 * The flow generator does NOT ask the LLM to emit raw ReactFlow JSON — that format is
 * full of load-bearing trivia a model will fumble (edges without sourceHandle/targetHandle
 * are silently dropped by the FlowBuilder on load; edge ids must follow
 * `source:handle->target:handle`; handle ids are a fixed per-node-type vocabulary;
 * `properties.mcpNodes` is derived from MCP edges by the FlowConverter and must never be
 * hand-authored). Instead the model emits a compact semantic {@link FlowSpec} and this
 * pure, deterministic compiler produces the ReactFlow JSON: uuids, layered layout,
 * handle ids, edge ids, MCP nodes + mcp edges, markers.
 *
 * MULTI-LEVEL (issue #94): a subflow node can reference an existing flow (`flow`) OR carry
 * an inline child {@link FlowSpec} (`subflowSpec`). Inline children are compiled into their
 * OWN flows and the parent subflow node's `subflowId` is wired to the compiled child's id.
 * The compiler therefore returns a BUNDLE of flows ({@link CompileResult.flows}) in
 * dependency order (descendants before the root) so the caller can persist them
 * descendants-first, keeping every `subflowId` resolvable. `CompileResult.flow` remains the
 * ROOT flow for back-compatibility with the single-flow callers. Recursion is bounded by a
 * hard depth cap and a total-flow cap. A third field, `generateSubflow`, is a
 * generator-only instruction (a natural-language description of a child to auto-generate);
 * the deterministic compiler cannot fulfil it and flags it — the LLM generator expands it
 * into a `subflowSpec` before compiling.
 *
 * The compiler is BEST-EFFORT: it always returns a flow when at least one node is usable,
 * recording everything it skipped or could not resolve as {@link CompileIssue}s. Semantic
 * problems (unknown model, unresolved subflow target, …) surface here or in the follow-up
 * `validateFlow` pass and feed the generator's repair loop; the reviewed-in-builder draft
 * is the final safety valve, so a flawed flow is still worth returning.
 *
 * Kept in utils/shared: pure data-in/data-out, no services, safe for backend and browser.
 * The edge shapes deliberately mirror the builder's `createEdgeFromConnection`
 * (FlowBuilder/Canvas/utils/edgeUtils.ts) + `mcpEdgeOptions` (Canvas/types.ts) — the
 * compiler must not import frontend component modules, so the shapes are re-declared here
 * and pinned to the originals by __tests__/flow/flowSpecCompiler.test.ts.
